# Column Layout
This TYPO3 extension adds column configuration to fluid styled content elements.
It provides a maintainable grid/column layout for the editor.

## Motivation
So far grid layouts in the frontend can only be achieved through backend layouts. You have to create many backend layouts to cover any case.
There are already a [few](https://extensions.typo3.org/?L=0&id=1&tx_solr%5Bq%5D=grid) grid extensions but they do not integrate well with TYPO3's localization or suffer other complications.
This extension provides a very simple, yet powerful, way to deal with dynamic grid/column layouts.

## Installation
The preferred way to install this extension is via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):
```bash
composer require arndtteunissen/column-layout
```

## Documentation
